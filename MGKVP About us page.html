	             Babu Shiv Prasad Gupt and Bhagwan Das established the university in Varanasi, on 10 February 1921, during the non-cooperation movem
	             ent of the freedom Originally named Kashi Vidyapith, the university was renamed Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith in 1995. It was inaugur
		     ated by Mahatma Gandhi.Inspired by Gandhi's call for self-reliance and swaraj (self-rule), the Kashi Vidyapith was the first modern university
			  
		     organised by Indians in British India. The university, along with contemporaries such as the Jamia Millia Islamia and the Gujarat Vidyapith,
		     were outside the control and support of British authorities, supported and managed entirely by Indian nationalists and educationalists.Attra
		     cting young Indians from across the country, its faculty included prominent nationalists and scholars such as Acharya Narendra Dev, Dr. R
		     ajendra Prasad, Jivatram Kripalani, Babu Shriprakash and Babu Sampurnanand.Gandhi and Indian nationalists encouraged Indians to bo
			 
		     ycott British-run institutions in favour of institutions managed entirely by Indians. Many prominent Indian industrialists and politicians pro
		     vided financial and administrative support to the university.Bhagwan Das was the first vice-chancellor. Others associated with the first boar
		     d of management included Mahatma Gandhi, Lala Lajpat Rai Jamuna Lal Bajaj, Jawahar Lal Nehru, Babu Shiv Prasad Gupta, Acharya Nare
		     ndra Dev, Krishna Kant Malviya,and Purushottam Das Tandon. The founding ceremony of the Vidyapith reverberated with the recital of Ve
		     dic mantras as well as excerpts from the Quran in the presence of educationists, learned persons and nationalists such as Pandit Motilal Neh
			 
		     ru,Maulana Mohammed Ali and Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.Established with the resolution to keep the institution away from government reco
	             gnition and grants the Vidyapith was accorded the status of "Deemed University" by the UGC in 1963. This epoch-making event started a
	             new chapter for the institution. Babu Sampurnanand was appointed as the chancellor and Acharya Birbal Singh as vice-chancellor. As the
		     chief minister of Uttar Pradesh (U.P.), Pt.Kamlapati Tripathi initiated a state government resolution  to make his alma mater a  statutory 
			 
	             university; this happened on 15 January 1974. At this point, Prof. Raghukul Tilak was the vice-chancellor and the Governor of  U.P. became
		     the chancellor in accordance with the U.P. University Act. At present, the M.G. Kashi Vidyapith is flourishing under the able leadership
		     of Vice-Chancellor, Prof. T.N. Singh

		       <pre id="d13">
		     Mahatma Gandhi Kashi Vidyapith owes its birth to the educational, cultural and political aspirations of pre-independence India. The early
		     period of this institution pulsated with the national freedom struggle. The teaching provided original dimensions to the concept and move
		     ment of Indian socialism. After seeing an educational institution in Japan during a visit in 1913ï¿½14, Prasad Gupt was inspired to establ
		     ish an institution in India, free from government aid or interference. The boycott of government-aided educational institutions during the
	             non-cooperation movement coupled with Mahatma Gandhi's programme of National Education exerted a great deal of influence on Prasad 
		     Gupt. As a consequence, the Vidyapith came into being. Students joining Mahatma Gandhi's boycott call took admission in the Vidyapith.
		     Shiv  Prasad Gupta established the "Har Prasad Smarak Nidhi" in memory of his deceased brother, for the operation of the Vidyapith, whi
		     ch subsequently proved to be a fertile nursery of National Freedom movement activities.
